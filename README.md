Jarls of India is a mod for the Grand Strategy game Crusader Kings 3 by Paradox Interactive.

## About
**The Norse have ventured far and wide, from Vinland to Kiev, from the northern swathes of Scandinavia to the islands of the Mediterranean. But by chance, they find themselves in a new land. A new land to pillage, to conquer... to rule.**

Jarls of India will add flavour to the Norse should they manage to get a foothold in India.
* Indo-Norse and Dravidian-Norse melting pot cultures!
* Unify India under the banner of Od(h)in!
* A Bookmark to start in the Maldives!
* A new Hindu-Germanic religion!
* Flavor titles for Indo-Norse rulers
* Customised opinion modifiers for Hindus and Norse alike

Special thanks to Riso, Blarghalt and Veni Vidi Vici, who created the original mod for CK2, to which this one is a spiritual successor.
