 bm_rajas_desc:0 "I, Ragnar Herse, have done what nobody dared! Leading my huscarls boldly for many years in the Mediterranean, I stole the gold of the Franks, the wheat of the Arabs and the holy icons of the Italians, wrought in jewels and precious metals. Eventually I heard of a land made of silk and gems, and I could not resist the idea of raiding there. I gathered my family and troops and set out to that far land. Now, after many battles, I rule a group of islands called the Maldives. From here raiding the land will be easy. Indians are no match for our warriors. Their women will be ours, their sons will lament their fathers and their riches will fill our boats. A great legacy by any measure! But when I look at my son Styrkar I ask myself: Why stop there? Why be content with pillaging the wealth of the land when we could take that very land for ourselves?"
