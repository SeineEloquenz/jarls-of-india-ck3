 EVTDESC_jarls_coronation.1:0 "It has been century upon century since Great India was last unified under a single banner. Not even Alexander the Great could fully conquer it, but we Northmen have accomplished what he could not. I, [Root.GetTitledFirstName], crown myself Emperor of all India, in the name Odin, in the name of Thor and in the name of Freyr."\n\nWhere they were once mere raiders, the Vikings have elevated themselves to the absolute rulers of the faraway subcontinent. One of their own, [Root.GetTitledFirstName], has been declared Emperor of India, a title not truly held since Ashoka the Great. [This.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] help us all."
 EVTOPTA_jarls_coronation.1:0 "For Odin! For Thor! For Freyr!"

 become_emperor_of_india_desc:0 "It has been long since India has been united, but only one group of men possess the strength to do it once more: the Norse! If we can secure a strong enough position, the Rajas will have no choice but to recognize a Norseman as High Emperor of India."

 EVTDESCmp.0:0 "Long ago our ancestors arrived in this strange land of six-armed gods to conquer and pillage in the name of Odin. Children nowadays have only heard of Scandinavia in half-forgotten stories. We've adopted so much of the native culture as our own that we must ask ourselves: Are we Norse, or something...different?"
 EVTOPTA_MP_0:0 "If only these Indians knew how to make a good runestone."

 EVTOPTA_MP_1:0 "For Odin! For Thor! For Freyr!"
 EVTNAMEmp.2:0 "Strangers in a strange land"
 EVTDESCmp.2:0 "The odd religions of these Indians continue to pound against our own like Thor's Hammer, and with every passing year another handful of men forgets his devotion to Thor in favor of Shiva or Buddha. This cannot stand. The most respescted Norse priests have approached you and called for a reorganization of the old custom in India, with a standardized holy book and church."
 EVTOPTA_MP_2:0 "May our faith become stronger than Yggdrasil's mighty roots."
 EVTOPTB_MP_2:0 "Never! The old ways are best!"
 EVTNAMEmp.3:0 "The Lodbroks"
 EVTDESCmp.3:0 "Just as Old Hairy-Breeches was the scourge of Christians, so shall we be the scourge of the Indians. The march will be long, the trials fierce, but the glory shall be everlasting in Valhalla! Ready the longboats!"\n\nThe drums of war continue to beat in the faraway land of India, where the Norse lords are fighting a losing battle. The Lodbroks, named after the greatest viking to ever live, have formed to reinforce the sons and daughters of Odin in the Far East."
 EVTOPTA_MP_3:0 "We shall never surrender!"
 EVTOPTB_MP_3:0 "Bah! The bickering of heathens does not concern me."
 EVTNAMEmp.5:0 "The Sack of Mecca"
 EVTDESCmp.5:0 "Your raiders have captured Mecca, and you quickly go to work seizing anything of importance from the great holy city. Your men take books, gold, prisoners, and even pieces of the city itself as souvenirs, torching the rest. Flames and smoke dance around the angular black edges of the Kaaba as you return to your longboat."
 EVTOPTA_MP_5:0 "Odin has blessed this journey."
 EVTNAMEmp.6:0 "The Wanderers"
 EVTDESCmp.6:0 "Boldened by the news of Norse conquests in the Far East, a loose collection of vikings have banded together and begun the long march to India. They call themselves The Wanderers, and are more than ready to fight for anyone who can promise them enough coin and glory."
 EVTOPTA_MP_6:0 "I wish them luck."
 EVTOPTB_MP_6:0 "You mean to tell me those blasted pirates are moving? Excellent!"
 EVTNAMEmp.7:0 "A whole new world"
 EVTDESCmp.7:0 "News from the south! Tjudmund Aleson, a banished son looking for his own claim to renown, set forth a large expedition in attempt to find land to claim as his own. He navigated around the great island chain to the east, then south. Just as they were about to turn around, one of she ships spotted what appeared to be a huge island.\n\nHis supplies were too exhausted to make anything more than a quick expedition, but initial forays revealed that the land is dominated by a large desert beyond the shores. Even more amazing is that the land is already inhabited by other people! For now, Tjudmund has returned, swearing an oath that he will eventually explore his discovery in full."
 EVTOPTA_MP_7:0 "Just how big is this world?"
 EVTNAMEmp.8:0 "Settlers reach Dryland"
 EVTDESCmp.8:0 "After several more expeditions, explorers have come to the conclusion that this new land is either the largest island in the world, or a new continent altogether. Tjudmund Aleson has started a small settlement on the northern coast of this new land, and so far has only had minor skirmishes with the natives.\n\n He calls this new place Dryland, possibly to lure Norsemen who are tired of India's sweltering jungles."
 EVTOPTA_MP_8:0 "Dryland, hm?"
 EVTNAMEmp.9:0 "Discovery of New Norway"
 EVTDESCmp.9:0 "Toki Tjudmundson, great-grandson of the great explorer Tjudmund Aleson, has discovered land to the far east of Dryland! Nobody knows what possessed him to sail out into the open ocean, but there he discovered two big islands, and dubbed them collectively as New Norway.\n\nThe story of his exploration boggles the mind. He claims to have found insects as heavy as a man's fist, tiny flightless birds, and even eagles that equal a man in size and pick can him off the ground with ease. These accounts would normally be dismissed as pure fiction if his crew handn't captured one of the great eagles and brought it back as proof."
 EVTOPTA_MP_9:0 "A tale for the ages!"
 EVTNAMEmp.10:0 "The Great Southern Land"
 EVTDESCmp.10:0 "Mathematicians and philosophers the world over have always speculated that there must be some mysterious continent to the south, and now they have been proven correct. An exiled Norseman all the way from Denmark known only as Olaf the Black arrived in India several years ago, and managed to scrounge up enough resources for an expedition. Sailing straight south, he and his crew spotted several island before finally catching sight of the frozen shores of the Great Southern Land.\n\nFrom Olaf's accounts, the unknown land is almost completely encased in ice, yet life still thrives there, as penguins and seals can be found up and down the coast. Even the white-eyed whales congregate there in high numbers."
 EVTOPTA_MP_10:0 "I always knew there was something down there."
 EVTNAMEmp.11:0 "Farewell to Thee"
 EVTDESCmp.11:0 "Not content with just finding the frozen southern continent, Olaf the Black staged a second expedition based out of Dryland, going out farther than any Norse explorer before him. Entire months were spent in the great eastern sea, and many of his crew died of disease and hunger, but they finally made landfall in a strange land dotted with volcanoes, lush jungles and odd natives. Fortunately, the meeting with the locals was peaceful, and Olaf retuned with a shipload of gifts."
 EVTOPTA_MP_11:0 "Good for him."
 EVTOPTD_RoI_412:0 "Just kill them. My men need the exercise."
 EVTOPTC_RoI_2120:0 "RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!"
 EVTOPTB_RoI_2121:0 "Wha? Where am I? What happened?"
 EVTDESC_RoI_2126:0 "Your rage overcomes you. Throwing your spear aside, you charge the beast, arms outstretched and foam pouring out of your mouth, blacking out as your fists connect with the tiger's face. You come to your senses moments later and find yourself covered in blood, guts and striped patches of fur. You have torn the great tiger apart with your bare hands."
 EVTOPTD_RoI_3100:0 "Turn this arrogant Guru into a Blood Eagle!"
 sea_king:0 "Sea King"
 sea_king_desc:0 "This individual has gained infamy as one of the most feared pirates in the world."
