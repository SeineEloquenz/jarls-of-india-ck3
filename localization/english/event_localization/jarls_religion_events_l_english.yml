 convert_to_hindu_germanic_desc:0 "The Indian religions have so many traditions in common, and the people's beliefs are so mixed, that it is not impossible for a person to simply choose to convert from one of the religions to another. Such a choice may only be made once in a lifetime, however."

 EVTDESC_jarls_religion.1n:0 "When our forefathers arrived in this strange India so many years ago they could have never imagined our own gods waiting for them. They had strange forms and unrecognisable names, fighting battles we had never heard about. Our people were naturally suspicious and thought it a trick of the monkey Lokhi.\n\nYet over time we saw the truth. The gods had arrived a long time before our people, preparing this land for us in spirit so we may take its body. "Odhin's wisdom guided us as we strived to make the old Germanic and Hindu as it was supposed to be: United as one."

 EVTOPTB_TOG_67001:0 "Meh. Not today."
 EVTDESC_TOG_67002:0 "[From.GetTitledFirstName] offers no resistence as the guards pull them out of your dungeons. You begin to believe the Jain will say nothing at all until the noose is finally tightened around their neck and they quietly ask you to not do this, for your own souls sake."
