There are those who argue that it's best to stay neutral and anger no one."
 jarls_religion.1.t:0 "United in one faith"
 jarls_religion.1.desc:0 "When our forefathers arrived in this strange India so many years ago they could have never imagined our own gods waiting for them. They had strange forms and unrecognisable names, fighting battles we had never heard about. Our people were naturally suspicious and thought it a trick of the monkey Lokhi.\n\nYet over time we saw the truth. The gods had arrived a long time before our people, preparing this land for us in spirit so we may take its body. "Odhin's wisdom guided us as we strived to make the old Germanic and Hindu as it was supposed to be: United as one."
